# 👋 Hi, I'm Hadi Moali

I'm a Final Year Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Bath, specialising in **R&D, simulation, and mechatronic system design**.  
My work combines **FEA**, **CFD**, and **embedded systems** to build advanced physical systems—  
from smart coffee machines to thermally-enhanced manufacturing solutions.

🎓 MEng Mechanical Engineering – University of Bath  
🏅 Shortlisted for Geoff Herrington Innovation Award 2025
